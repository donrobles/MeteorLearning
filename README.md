#Intermediate Meteor App
This is a fairly simple Meteor application that was created while following the 
[Intermediate Meteor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI8IslJHSag&list=PLLnpHn493BHFYZUSK62aVycgcAouqBt7V) tutorial 
from [LevelUpTuts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyU5wkjgQYGRB0hIHMwm2Sg).

If you feel like learning more about what Meteor can do, follow along with the tutorial yourself, writing the code and 
 listening to the how everything operates together.
 
I put a lot of comments all over the place here so that you can get pull it down and understand where everything is 
being called from and referenced to, it's not perfect, but it may give you a better idea as to what's going on with Meteor
itself.

Also, I found an issue with the CSS that used from the tutorial, your spans for the menu will not line up properly. I 
forget what exactly the fix was (I'm adding this README well after I finished the tutorial), but it had something to do 
with the stylus package, and it's use of "lost-center" and "lost-column" in `styles.styl`.
